## Mass Spectrometers
Mass specs are a precious resource and should be treated as such. We are lucky to have them and get to use them as we do.

### Scheduling time on the mass specs
We will discuss upcoming mass spec usage at lab meetings weekly. If you plan to have samples please come to the meeting knowning:

1. The number of samples
2. The method you will need to use and the gradient time.
3. Importance of these samples. Do you need data in two days for a grant? 2 months for paper revisions?


You are responsible for making sure that the insturment is good working order before and after your runs. This includes:

1. Running standards (e.g., hypro) before your run to make sure the instrument is functioning well.
2. Ensuring that a recent MS calibration has been performed.
3. Ensuring that the wash solution (TFE), syringe buffer (Buffer A), and gradient buffers have adequate liquid in them.
4. Make sure that the instrument looks and sounds in working order.

If you notice something out of the ordinary or have an issue...**ASK!** Better to ask and let us address something then to have a small issue become a large issue.
